Readme for myco_trait_analysis.

All data construction and analysis for Averill et al. in review. mycorrhizal traits.

All file paths are specified in paths.r. This is structured in such a way that if a core set of raw data files are passed along, the user can replicate all database generation and analysis.

Currently, this can't happen for two reasons:
1. We cannot publicly share the TRY data request.
2. I keep worldclim2 rasters separate somehwere.
